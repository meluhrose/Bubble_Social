# This document is dedicated to my AI usage for this assignment

Here are all the AI logs that I could account for in this document as the brief had been updated on Monday (16.02.26) and I have been working on this assignment for the past 3 weeks. I will try my best to include what I remembered.

Tool used: ChatGPT

# Week 1 (02.01-08.02)

Purpose: Project Planning/Project Board
Outcome: This helped me have a better oversight on what is to be done and allowed me to break down the tasks in to smaller ones so that it didn't make the project looked as big as I thought it was. This allowed me to get a head start on getting started on the project.



# Week 2 (09.02-15.02)

Purpose: Handling JWT decoding and understanding Base64 encoding.
Outcome: I got a better understanding of how JWTs are structured and how the payload is endoded using Base64. This allow me to implement logic to safely decode the token, normalize the Base64 string and extract user information such as name and email from the payload.

Purpose: Rendering posts correctly, including author information and optional images.
Outcome: I improved the way posts are rendered in the feed to dynamically display available content while safely handling missing data. My feed now displays posts more reliably and professionaly, without broken images or undefined values. 


# Week 3 (16.02-20.02)

Purpose: Improve Infinite Scroll logic and API Fetching
Outcome: Helped me detect errors in my code when scrollObserver was causing issues with edit posts and searching through posts. Now my search engine searches through all posts as opposed to the uploaded posts and doesn't cause refresh when clicking edit in edit post. 

Purpose: Structuring my JavaScript files
Outcome: Helped me understand how to import/export functions allowing to share functions throughout other files. This structure reduces duplication, improves readabilit and easier to debug.
